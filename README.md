**Book Recommendation System with Collaborative Filtering and Streamlit**\
This project is a book recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering to suggest books to users based on their preferences. The frontend of the system is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. Users can type or select a book, and upon selection, the system displays detailed information about the selected book, as well as recommended books, books by the same author, books by the same publisher, and top popular books. Users can explore different books based on mood, genre and Indian languages.\

**Introduction**\
The book recommendation system employs collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized book recommendations to users. Collaborative filtering is based on the idea that users who have liked or interacted with similar books in the past are likely to have similar preferences.

The system's frontend is built using Streamlit, which provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the recommendation system. Users can search for books by typing or selecting from a list and get detailed information about the book, including its cover, author, title, description, genre, and publisher. They can also receive recommendations for other books, see books by the same author or from the same publisher, and discover top popular books.\
